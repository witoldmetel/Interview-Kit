# Interview Kit

In this template you can now run `yarn storybook` to start ondevice storybook or `yarn start` to start your expo app.
This works via env variables and expo constants.

```sh
# either
yarn storybook

# ios
yarn storybook:ios

# android
yarn storybook:android
```

If you add new stories on the native (ondevice version) you either need to have the watcher running or run the stories loader

To update the stories one time

```sh
yarn storybook-generate
```

To watch the stories files

```sh
yarn storybook-watch
```

Note that this is only necessary for when you add or remove a story file.

# Web

Start react native web storybook:

```
yarn storybook:web
```

build react native web storybook:

```sh
yarn build-storybook
```
